<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A mobile app that allows users to interact with the Cascade bicycle club in an easy and intuitive way. The app includes features such as an Events Calendar, Classes, Blogs, Club Programs, Street views, and much more

### Motivation

Cascade Bicycle Club, the nationâ€™s largest statewide bicycling nonprofit, serves bike riders of all ages, races, genders, income levels, and abilities throughout the state of Washington. We currently have a website (https://cascade.org) but would like to expand our reach and increase awareness with a mobile app.

In 2015, UW students built a Group Ride Finder app (https://cascade.org/about-free-group-ride-finder-app), However, that's no longer in use. 2021 students can provide a mobile app that lets our audience easily interact with Cascade.
